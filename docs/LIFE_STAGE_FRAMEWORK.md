### Event Generation (LLM Integration)

Events are generated by Claude using this context:

```
Character State:
- Current stats
- Life history (key events)
- Active relationships
- Recent choices
- Current life stage

Generation Prompt:
"Generate a {positive/negative/neutral/dramatic} event for a {age}-year-old 
{gender} named {name} who is currently {situation summary}. 

The event should:
1. Be appropriate for their life stage
2. Reference their history when relevant
3. Present 2-4 meaningful choices
4. Have consequences that affect specific stats
5. Potentially connect to ongoing storylines

Recent context: {last 5 events}
Active storylines: {ongoing narratives}
Mood target: {current happiness trajectory}"
```

## Part 4: Death Mechanics

### Natural Death Probability

Death probability calculated each year after age 60:

```
Base_Death_Rate = 0.01 (1%)

Age_Factor:
  60-70: × 1.0
  70-80: × 2.0
  80-90: × 4.0
  90-100: × 8.0
  100+: × 16.0

Health_Factor:
  Health 80-100: × 0.5
  Health 60-80: × 1.0
  Health 40-60: × 2.0
  Health 20-40: × 4.0
  Health 0-20: × 10.0

Final_Death_Probability = Base × Age_Factor × Health_Factor

Example: 85-year-old with Health 50
= 0.01 × 4.0 × 2.0 = 8% chance per year
```

### Early Death Possibilities

| Cause | Age Range | Trigger | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Childhood illness | 0-5 | Low health, bad luck | Parent care quality |
| Accident | Any | Risk-taking choices | Caution, luck |
| Illness | Any | Random + lifestyle | Health maintenance |
| Violence | 10+ | Location + choices | Avoid danger |
| Substance | 15+ | Addiction path | Avoid/treat addiction |
| Suicide | 12+ | Happiness < 10 sustained | Mental health care |
| Reckless | 15-30 | High-risk choices | Caution |
| Medical | 40+ | Lifestyle + genetics | Health focus |

### Death Event Flow

```
1. Death Trigger Detected
   ↓
2. Generate Death Scene (LLM)
   - Circumstances
   - Who's present
   - Final moments
   ↓
3. Final Words (if conscious)
   - Player types final words
   - Distributed to family/heirs
   ↓
4. Life Summary Generated
   - Key stats final values
   - Major achievements
   - Relationships summary
   - Legacy score calculated
   ↓
5. Obituary Generated (LLM)
   - Written in news style
   - Highlights and lowlights
   - Survivor list
   ↓
6. Inheritance Distribution
   - Net worth divided
   - Belongings assigned
   - Family drama potential
   ↓
7. "Play as heir?" Option
   - Continue legacy
   - Or start fresh
```

### Legacy Score Calculation

```
Legacy_Score = (
  Career_Peak × 0.15 +
  Relationship_Quality_Average × 0.20 +
  Children_Success × 0.15 +
  Net_Worth_Tier × 0.10 +
  Unique_Achievements × 0.15 +
  People_Helped × 0.15 +
  Reputation_Final × 0.10
) × Longevity_Bonus

Longevity_Bonus:
  Died < 40: × 0.5
  Died 40-60: × 0.75
  Died 60-80: × 1.0
  Died 80+: × 1.25
  Died 100+: × 1.5
```

### Inheritance System

```
Net_Worth Distribution:
- Spouse: 50% default
- Children: Split 50% equally
- Modified by: Will choices, family relationships

Heir Inheritance:
- Receives: Money, property, items
- Inherits: Family reputation (+/-)
- Genetic: Some stat tendencies
- NOT inherited: Career, education, relationships
```

### Death and Social Discovery

When a character dies:
1. They appear in "Recently Died" featured section for 24 hours
2. Death announcement shown to players who previously viewed them
3. Obituary becomes permanent memorial page
4. Children/heirs gain "Recently Bereaved" boost in discovery
5. Legacy score affects posthumous discovery ranking

**Total Actions (to age 75): ~455 decisions**

### LLM Context Requirements

Each action requires Claude to have:
```

  "character_profile": { /* all stats */ },
  "life_history": [ /* array of past events, summarized */ ],
  "active_relationships": [ /* current NPCs with relationship data */ ],
  "current_situation": { /* immediate context */ },
  "available_actions": [ /* valid actions for this stage */ ],
  "recent_context": [ /* last 3-5 events in detail */ ],
  "active_storylines": [ /* ongoing narratives */ ]
}
```
